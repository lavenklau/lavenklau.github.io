abstract = {We propose an effective shape optimization method to generate mechanically robust, lightweight porous structures. Central to our algorithm is a non-uniform thermal conduction process, which diffuses from the given heat source to minimize structure compliance under the volume-bounded constraint. The diffusivity at each voxel forms the design variable set, and the structure compliance is differentiable concerning the diffusivities; thus, we can easily reformulate the traditional topology optimization to update diffusivities for compliance minimization. Our method is able to receive various heat sources as inputs. To make the optimized structures porous, the input heat sources are constrained to be porous, e.g., wireframe models, stress lines inputs. This framework is available for 2D and 3D porous structure generation. We demonstrate the robustness and practicability of our method over various models.}
